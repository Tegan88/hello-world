# hello-world
just another repository
Hi Everyone,

It has been a long week. I am so happy I was able to attend #blockstacksummit 2017. I learned a lot of good information and iit has inspired me to make an attempt to create decentralized apps for the network. I hope I succeed. Learning to code is going to be a great test and excercise for my spelling and grammer skills.
I hope I got that right! Can't wait to get started.

Tim
